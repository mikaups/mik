# Sign-up app

This project is a kind of summarize of our classes. I've used all technologies we were using at our course in a simple app. It's a form where you can enter your data, and then they'll be saved in the MongoDB and the form will be cleaned and ready for another record.

## Used technologies
* React version 17.0.1 - frontend
* Node.js - backend
* MongoDB - database
* Bootstrap 4.6.0 - style
* package.json version 1.0.0
* Express version 4.17.1 - it's great help to connect with database
* Nodemon version 2.0.7 - it's restart Node app whenever new changes appear
* Mongoose version 5.11.13 - it's a MongoDB object modeling tool
* Dotens version 8.2.0 - it's helps to hide files with private information like login and password to db
* Cors version 2.8.5 - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
* VSC's extension REST Client version 0.24.3 - it's allow to easy check POST function
